SEARCHING THEORY
===================
-2 popular ways to search thru a list(of Strings,Objects,Numbers,etc):
Linear Search-> Start at first item move down 1 at a time until match is found 
-> if no match, it won t know until it goes through entire list.
Binary Search-> Start at middle point of list. If item is higher, adjust left side to midpoint +1 
If item is lower, adjust right side to midpoint-1.Search at new midpoint and repeat until either item is found, or left and right sides collide with each other
-Binary Search can only be used if items are sorted in some way(alpha, numeric)

-Binary search can only be used if items are sorted by some way

OBJECTS AND SEARCHING
=====================
Objects from classes can be searchable if the class implements comparable
public class something implements comparable(Something){
-Then you decide which instance variable will be used for searching/ comparing purpose
-lastly you include a compareto method that returns a comparison of the property with another same type of objects same property
-compareto returns an 'int' so if you are comparing 2 strings you can use the String compareTo on that property
-for ints's you can do a calculated difference between 2 values, or just return +1,-1 or 0 depending on which one is greater.
-then the collection of objects you are searching, through must be sorted by the compareto property in order to do a binary search.
